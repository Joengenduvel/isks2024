# Introduction and Goals

**Hour Registration Reminder and Reward System**
1. Executive Summary
* Objective: Implement a system to remind developers to fill in their hour registration weekly, ensuring timely and accurate billing.
* Goals: Improve compliance with hour registration, enhance billing accuracy, and incentivize timely submissions.
2. Problem Statement
* Current Issue: Developers often forget to log their hours on time, leading to delays in billing and potential revenue loss.
* Impact: Delayed hour registration affects project tracking, client billing, and overall financial management.
3. Proposed Solution
* Reminder System: Automated reminders via email, chat, or project management tools to prompt developers to log their hours.
* Chase Mechanism: Escalation process for repeated non-compliance, including notifications to team leads or managers.
* Reward System: Incentives for timely submissions, such as recognition, small bonuses, or additional time off.
4. Benefits
* Financial: Improved cash flow and revenue recognition due to timely billing.
* Operational: Enhanced project tracking and resource management.
* Employee Engagement: Increased motivation and accountability among developers.


## Requirements Overview

1. Reminder System: The system should be able to send automated reminders to developers via email, chat, or project management tools to prompt them to log their hours.
2. Chase Mechanism: There should be an escalation process in place for repeated non-compliance, including notifications to team leads or managers to chase up on late submissions.
3. Reward System: The system should support incentives for timely submissions, such as recognition, small bonuses, or additional time off.


## Quality Goals

1. Service times: The reminder and reward system should have defined service times for sending reminders and processing submissions.
2. Availability requirements: The system should have high availability to ensure that reminders and rewards are consistently delivered without downtime.
3. Performance requirements: The system should perform efficiently to handle a large number of reminders and submissions without delays.
4. Issue handling: There should be mechanisms in place to handle any technical or operational issues that may arise with the reminder and reward system.
5. Disaster recovery: The system should have measures in place to recover from any potential disasters or disruptions to ensure continuous operation.
